*Into the Deep* is a show written and performed by Oberlin Circus, an Oberlin student circus group. This show was unique from a lighting perspective since it was performed in an old gymnasium. Being the second show I have done in this space we were able to use more lights and through the use of deep blues and gobos the space was given a feeling of being under water using minimal lights.
