Daniel Moses is a lighting designer, physicist, and computer scientist. When not lighting theater, dance, or circus they are researching hydrogen storage methods in Professor FitzGerald's lab and learning about quantum computing. Since 2018 Daniel has worked on 26 shows focusing mainly on lighting design but doing everything from spotlight to sound operating.

In 2019 Daniel founded Oberlin's Student Lighting and Sound Association, SLSA, with Kiera Saltz. Working together on the student organization they made its goal to provide technical support to Oberlin campus's many students shows and to teach each generation of students how to use lighting and sound equipment. SLSA grew quickly gaining a budget of $4,000-$11,000 a semester to purchase new equipment.
